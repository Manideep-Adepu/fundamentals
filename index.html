                <h2>Lenove Unveils the First Transparent Display Laptop</h2>
                <p>Lenovo has unveiled the world's first transparent laptop at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2024 event in Barcelona, unveiling a 17.3-inch spectacle straight out of a science fiction film. The ThinkBook Transparent Concept features a borderless screen, a transparent keyboard area and a floating footpad. The laptop has a 17.3-inch borderless screen with up to 55 per cent transparency when the pixels are set to black and set to black, although the display becomes less transparent when the pixels light up. The concept laptop has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits and a 720p display, according to The Verge.</p>

                <p>However, unlike most premium offerings, the Lenovo Thinkpad Transparent does not have an AMOLED panel, but a MicroLED display instead. The MicroLED display is touted to offer better saturation, transparency, brightness and image quality compared to its OLED alternative, reports the Times of India.</p>
                <p>Apart from the transparent display, Lenovo's concept video also showed a flat touch keyboard, which is a projection rather than an actual keyboard, and the keyboard starts to disappear when you bring the pen close to the Thinkbook. Lenovo said the transparent laptop could be particularly useful for artists or architects, allowing them to sketch.</p>

                <h2>White Desert Of India: The Great Rann of Kutch</h2>
                <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170929174315-great-rann-of-kutch.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_900,w_1599,c_fill" alt="" width="550px">
                <p>
                    <span>On the edge of western India, a pure white desert seems to shimmer under the blazing sun.</span><br><br>
                    <span>This is the Rann of Kutch, home to India’s largest salt plain, in the Kutch district of the westernmost state of Gujarat.</span><br><br>
                    The Kutch district contains one of the largest salt deserts in the world: the Rann of Kutch. (Rann means desert in Hindi.) Although the desert is largely in India’s Gujarat state, some parts extend into the Sindh province of Pakistan. Spanning 26,000 square kilometers (10,000 square miles), the Rann was a shallow arm of the Arabian Sea thousands of years ago. It evolved into an extensive saline mudflat due to centuries of silting. During the dry season, the area has one of the highest annual evaporation rates in the region.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The shallow wetland is divided into two sections: the Great Rann of Kutch and Little Rann of Kutch. The Great Rann is a vast span of salt and known for its white, snowy look, which also makes it a popular filming spot for Bollywood movies. The Little Rann, which lies to the southeast, is known for its wildlife; it is one of the few places to spot the Indian onager. The area is also a popular birdwatching spot where visitors can see eagles, flamingos, cranes, and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During very wet years, the wetlands can extend to the Gulf of Kutch. Lined with mudflats and small islands, the Gulf of Kutch separates the Kutch district from the Kathiawar peninsula to the south. The gulf also includes the first marine conservatory in India: the Marine Sanctuary and Marine National Park. The park includes 42 islands, as well as coral reefs, sandy beaches, and diverse marine life.

               <img src="https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mango-juice-1.jpg" alt="" width="550px">
                <p>
                    1. First, rinse the mangoes very well under clean water. Dry them with a clean kitchen towel. Use a sharp knife or peeler to peel the skins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. Next, chop the mangoes and discard the stone. To separate the flesh from the center pit, first slice large chunks off on both sides of the stone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Transfer the chopped mangoes to a blender. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    4. Blend until smooth. Add a splash of water or milk (dairy or plant-based) to thin out slightly into a flowing runny juice, if you like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5. Serve the fresh juice immediately, or you can chill in the refrigerator. Feel free to garnish with your favorite juice or smoothie toppings, like chopped nuts, fresh berries, herbs or seeds.
